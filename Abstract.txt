 Title: Automated Buffer Overflow Attack using Python and Pwntools

Abstract:
Buffer overflow attacks are a common form of cyber attack that can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
on a vulnerable system. In this project, we demonstrate how to perform an automated buffer overflow attack on a
binary executable using Python and the Pwntools library. We use the argparse module to create command-line arguments
that allow the user to specify whether the target executable will be run locally or remotely, and to specify the remote
target's IP address and port number. We then use Pwntools to load the target executable into memory, construct a payload
that overflows the buffer and overwrites the return address to execute a specified function, and to send the
payload to the target executable either locally or remotely. Finally, the script enters interactive mode to allow
the user to interact with the target executable after the buffer overflow occurs. This project demonstrates how
Python and Pwntools can be used to automate the process of performing a buffer overflow attack,
making it easier for security professionals to test the vulnerability of systems and applications.
